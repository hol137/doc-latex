The antique concept of permanent Cosmos is reintroduced as a perfect deterministic Computer, inverting the anthropic principle and interpretating the dimensionless parameters as optimal calculation bases. The later are unified in the Topological Axis, which exhibits the string theory dimension series 4k+2, with the emphasis on the values 26 (visible Universe) and 10 (the Hydrogen - Pion couple). The 1D extension of the holographic principle, defining Grandcosmos, breaks the Planck wall by a factor of $10^{61}$, resolving at last the vacuum energy dilemma. 
The mathematics-physics fusion is confirmed by $10^{-9}$ precise relations, implying the Eddington's constant 137 together with  the Atiyah's constant, showing Four Force Unification.
The Holic Principle, Eddington's, Wyler's, Atiyah's and Sternheimer's approaches  must unlock the Particle Physics, with emphasis on the $10^{61}$ Trans-Plankian Quantized time, the Kotov's period, the Tifft's speed, the Koide-Sanchez constant, the Brannen matrix, the massive gluons and composite d quark. Standard Cosmology, based on the imperfect cosmological principle will be excluded by the observation of mature galaxies in the very far-field.

\section{The Principles of Hierarchy and Computation}
It was observed that the physical constants are tightly contrived, but only three dimensionless parameters: $a$, $p$, and $a_{G}$ are sufficient to explain the main structures of the world \cite{Carr}. Two of them are precisely measured: the electric constant $a$ $\approx$ 137.035999139(31), known with 0.23 ppb precision, and the proton-electron mass ratio $p$ $\approx$ 1836.15267245(75), known with 0.41 ppb precision. By contrast, the gravitational coupling constant $a_{G}$ was neither well defined nor measured, partially due to the relatively large imprecision on $G$ measurement 10$^{-4}\!$.

One can read \cite{Carr}: \textit{“For example, the size of a planet is the geometric mean of the size of the Universe and the size of an atom; the mass of man is the geometric mean of the mass of a planet and the mass of a proton. Such relationships, as well as the basic dependencies on $a$ and $a_G$ from which they derive, might be regarded as coincidences if one does not appreciate that they can be deduced from known physical theory, with the exception of the Universe, which cannot be explained directly from kwown physics... This line of arguments, which is discussed later, appeals to the 'anthropic principle'.”}

The existence of relations that are not explained by known physical theories, is called 'natural fine tuning' phenomena. But, as soon as it involves the observable Universe radius, it signals the existence of a more fundamental theory that must take into account the \textit{antique Cosmos concept, which, as Eddington claimed firstly \cite{Eddington}, must be permanent}. Extending this to the spatial homogeneity, this leads to the Perfect Cosmological Principle, the very foundation of the steady-state cosmology and the basis of Coherent Cosmology \cite{Sanchez1}.

So Eddington considered rightly the Cosmic Large Number correlations, as recalled in this article. But the rejection of Eddington's pioneer work was enforced by the fact that about 30 dimensionless parameters appear as 'free parameters' in the Particle standard model. They are misnamed, since, far from being really 'free', they are imposed by Nature. Nevertheless, a large majority of theorists believe they are due to chance, leading to a separation between Physics and Mathematics, not to speak of Biology. Thus, through the above Anthropic Principle, a majority believe in the Multiverse conundrum, a multiplicity of sterile Universe \cite{Carr}.

The present article shows that \textit{Physics is an unique part of Mathematics, which are presently uncomplete}, refuting the Multiverse Hypothesis by very precise fine-tuning ($10^{-9})$ between main physical and mathematical constants: $\pi$, $e$ and $\gamma$, the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Also, this study confirms the super-string theory but with complete rehabilitation of the \textit{tachyonic} bosonic string theory.

\textit{A decisive point of physics is the energy conservation, the First Principle of Thermodynamics.} Theorists associate it with time uniformity, but a more direct and logical explanation is that cosmos is a computer, so Intelligent Life receives a justification: to help the Cosmos computation. This Inverted Anthropic Principle answers the first of all questions: why one asks questions ? We propose that the parameters are optimal base in a Deterministic Computing Cosmos, and they appear indeed in DNA characteristics and triple-point temperatures of mammals and main molecules \cite{Sanchez1}.

\textit{This reinstates the Laplace determinism}, involving non-local hidden variables, which are identified with the Cosmos, so rejecting the standard Copenhagen statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics.

The fact that three parameters, amongst 30, are so clearly emerging means that physics, and more generally science, follows a hierarchical order: \textit{one can progress without knowing the details of the underlying fundamental theory.}

So, when Proust and Dalton found whole numbers in chemical reactions, they were prefiguring atomic physics. The same for Balmer, spectral lines and wave mechanics. Idem for Mandeleiev, atomic masses and nuclear physics. Also, when Mandel found whole numbers in Biology, he anticipated genetics. 

In the same manner, this article prefigures \textit{the fundamental theory, but precizing its arithmetical foundation: the Holic Principle}, recalled in section 6. Thus, there must exist multi-base algorithms able to explain the compatibility between these two principles, which seems at first sight contradictory.

\section {The Cosmic Fine-Tuning and the Topological Axis}
\markright{F.M. Sanchez,\ V.A. Kotov,\ M. Grosmann,\ D. Weigel,\ R. Veysseyre,\ C. Bizouard,\ N. Flawisky,\ D. Gayral,\ L. Gueroult, \textit{Back to Cosmos}}
We look here for a systematic organization of dimensionless physical quantities stemming from cosmology, astrophysics, particle   physics, theoretical physics and mathematics.
The most famous fine tuning implies cosmic quantities, awkwardly called the `Double
Large Number Problem`. If it is a `problem` for standard evolutionary cosmology, it is a precious
clue in the steady-state cosmology based on the \textit{Perfect} Cosmological Principle (spatial \textit{and} temporal homogeneity).
This Cosmological Fine-Tuning leads directly to a \textit{Gravitational Hydrogen molecule model of the visible universe} \cite{Sanchez1}.
Defining the Universe horizon radius with $R = 2a_{G} \lambdabar_{e}$ the factor 2 expresses its bi-atomic
Hydrogen molecule characteristics, where 
$\lambdabar_{e} = \hbar/cm_{e}$
is the Electron Compton reduced wavelength, and the
gravitational coupling constant is: 
$a_{G} = \hbar c/Gm_{p}m_{H}$
where $m_p$ and $m_H$ are the proton and hydrogen atom masses.
So, \textit{the speed $c$ is eliminated}, in accordance with
Coherent Cosmology which needs signal celerity far exceeding $c$. This gives $R \approx 13,812~Gly $, corresponding to a Hubble constant 70.790 (km/s)/Megaparsec, compatible with the
most recent measurements \cite{Bonvin}: 72(3) (km/s)/Megaparsec. The latter confirms the value measured by the 1a type novae, while the standard optimization of 6 parameters results in a lower value, by $9\%$.

Consider the wavelength of the visible Universe with critical mass $M= Rc^2/2G$: $$\lambdabar_{M} = \hbar /Mc \approx 4 \times 10^{-96} m$$ This `Topon` is close to the touchstone n = 30 of the Topological Axis, see Fig. 1. The Topological Axis illustrates the function $f(n + 4) = f^{2}(n)$
and stems from the imbrication of relations of the form 
$
\lambdabar_{e} /l_{micro} \sim (l_{macro} /\lambdabar_{e})^{2}
$
followed by 
$
l_{macro} /\lambdabar_{e} \sim (\lambdabar_{e} /l^{\prime}_{micro} )^{2}
$ leading to:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
%
\displaystyle
\lambdabar_{e}/\lambdabar_{M} \sim (R/\lambdabar_{e})^{2} \sim (\lambdabar_{e}/ \lambdabar_{X})^{4}\\[+8pt]  % 1st row
\sim (\lambda_{CMB}/ \lambdabar_{e})^{8} \sim (\lambdabar_{e}/\lambdabar_{W})^{16} \sim (2r_{H} /\lambdabar_{e})^{32}\\[+8pt] % 2nd row
\sim (\lambdabar_{e}/ l_{Gl} )^{64} \sim (\lambdabar_{str} /\lambdabar_{e} )^{128} \sim 2^{256}\\ % 3rd row
\end{array}
$$
These series include the Cosmic Microwave Background wavelength $\lambda_{CMB}$ and a string wavelength $\lambdabar_{str}$, with mass about 2 MeV. Hence, the correlation is eightfold,
including, apart from the two above relationships, three relations that have been independently reported \cite{Sanchez1}.
The overall large number $2^{256}$ has an obvious computational characteristic, confirmed below by the
dramatic appearance of the Eddington Large Number.

In particular, the relation $R/\lambdabar_{e} \sim (\lambda_{CMB} / \lambdabar_{e})^{4}$ ties two cosmic lengths, the Hubble radius and the CMB wavelength by a relation which is incompatible with the standard evolutionary cosmology. By this order of magnitude, we infer rather precise relations. With the Hydrogen radius $r_H$, we infer 
$
R/r_H \approx (4\pi \lambda_{CMB} /r_H)^{4}
$ 
precise to $0.6\%$. 
Considering the standard cosmological neutrino background (CNB), which wavelength is defined by $(\lambda_{CNB} / \lambda_{CMB})^{3} = 11/4$, we note that $R/ \lambdabar_{e} \approx
( \lambda_{CNB}^{2} / \lambda_{CMB} \lambdabar_{e} )^{4}$ to $1.7\%$.
The appearance of the neutrino field is conform
with the synthesis of the two main cosmologies, where the single Bang is replaced by a matter-
antimatter Oscillatory Bounce \cite{Sanchez2}.

It was noted in \cite{Carr} that $a_{G}$ is of order $W^{8}$, where $W$ is the mass ratio W boson-
Electron. With the above $R$ value, one observes the following more symmetrical relation involving
the other (neutral) weak boson Z, in the 0.01\% indetermination of $W$ and $Z$:
\begin{equation}
R/(\lambdabar_{p}\lambdabar_{H})^{1/2}\approx (WZ)^4
\end{equation}
where $\lambdabar_{p}$ and $\lambdabar_{H}$ are the Proton and Hydrogen reduced wavelengths. The precision of this formula will be pulled to the ppb range in section 9.4, by intervention of canonical mathematical constants.

The gravitational Hydrogen molecule model \cite{Sanchez1} implies the following double correlation,
which is the simplest case of Eddington's statistical theory \cite{Eddy}: the position of a `reference particle`
is supposed to be determined with an uncertainty of ${R/2}$. For N particles of mass $m$ components of the visible Universe, the deviance is statistically divided by $\sqrt{N}$, where $N = M/m$. If $m$ is the effective mass of the electron in the Hydrogen atom, $ m = m^{\prime}_{e} = m_{e} p/H$, and if, moreover, we equate
the deviance $R/(2\sqrt{(M/m^{\prime}_{e}))}$ to the Hydrogen wavelength $\lambdabar_{H} = \hbar/c m_{H}$, one obtains the double relation:
\begin{equation}
R/2\lambdabar_{H} = (M/m^{\prime}_{e})^{1/2} = \hbar c/G m_{e} m_{p}
\end{equation}
\textit{This is the definitive interpretation of the Double Large Number Fine-tuning}. So, while the two
pillars of Physics, Relativity and Quantum Theory are unable to conciliate Gravitation and Particle
Physics, the third pillar, Statistical Physics, directly makes this connection in cosmology \cite{Eddy}.

Recall that, contrary to what is often stated, quantum physics does not limit to micro-physics.
Indeed the exclusion principle applies in both solid state physics and in stellar physics. In particular,
for a star containing $N_s$ atoms, in which the pressure has reached the quantum degenerancy value
(case of white dwarfs), exclusion principle applies for electrons, and the radius star is about $R/N_{s}^{1/3}$
\cite{Sanchez1}. So the formula giving the Hubble radius $R$, a very difficult measurement which puzzled a whole
century, was already contained in astrophysics textbooks. The universe radius amazingly appears as
the limit of a mono-atomic star radius, for which the electrons are in degeneracy state. Eddingon was
aware of this Cosmologic Exclusion Principle, but could not conclude since, at his epoch, the
Hubble measurement for $R$ was false by an order of magnitude.

The reason for this discrepancy is that Lema\^itre and Hubble considered galaxies of the Local
Group, which do not participate the so-called space expansion. In fact, it is sufficient to introduce a
repulsive force proportional to separation distance, for explaination of the steady-state
exponential recession. There is no need of the so-called `dark energy`, the repulsive force is equivalent
to reintroduce the Einstein cosmological constant with invariant value $1/R^{2}$. 

The distance for which this force exceeds attractive
gravitation between galaxies is about $10^{6}$ light years \cite{Sanchez1}, which corresponds, in the Topological
Axis, to the Atiyah Constant $\Gamma$, presented in the Section 8.2, see Fig 1.

In the steady-state cosmology, such a repulsive force between galaxy groups is necessary, in
order to avoid a big chill due to the thermodynamics second principle. But, inside a galaxy group,
another evacuation mechanism must occur: \textit{it would be the role of massive black holes}.

\section{The Toponic Holographic Quantification}

In the steady-state cosmologic model of Bondi, Gold and Hoyle \cite{Sanchez1}, the Perfect Cosmological
Principle implies the invariance of the Universe mean mass density $\rho$ and the exponential recession
of galaxy groups, with time constant $R/c$ being compensated by the appearance of $m_n$ massive
neutrons at rate $c^{3} /Gm_{n}$, corresponding to about one neutron by century in a cathedral volume. The invariant visible Universe radius $R$ is then defined by the
Schwarszchild relation, so that each point is the center of an equivalent $R$-radius black hole, of
critical mass $M = Rc^{2} /2G$ and wavelength $\lambdabar_M = \hbar/Mc = 2l_{P}^{2} /R$, the above `Topon`. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of this black-hole Universe shows an 1D extension of the standard Holographic
Principle, until now devoted to 3D application only \cite{Bousso}:
\begin{equation}
S_{BH} = A/4 = \pi(R/l_{P})^{2} = 2\pi R/\lambdabar_{M}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the horizon sphere area and $l_{P} = (G\hbar/c^{3} )^{1/2}$ is the Planck's length. Note that, while the standard evolutionary cosmology use differential equations, which are not adapted to a single Universe, as Poincar\'{e} stated \cite{Sanchez1}, the Permanent Cosmology must favor such integral relations. This one
uses the \textit{Archimedes Testimony tying the Disk Area to its Perimeter}.

In the standard evolutionary view, the observed homogeneity of causally disconnected regions
of space is known as the so-called `horizon problem`, and is at the origin of the awkward inflation
hypothesis, which is unnecessary in the steady-state model. Indeed, the critical condition is
provided by the above very definition of $R$.

The cosmic wavelength $\lambdabar_{M}\sim 10^{-95} m$ breaks the `Planck's wall` by a factor $l_{P}/\lambdabar_{M}\sim 10^{61}$ : this explains why this holographic relation was long time unnoticed. Indeed, it was admitted that $l_{P}$ was the quantum of Space: in fact \textit{the Planck's length is an intermediate holographic length only}.

Gravitational potential energy of a critical homogeneous sphere is $-(3/5)GM^{2}/R = -
(3/10)Mc^{2}$, while the \textit{nonrelativistic} kinetic energy of galaxies is $(3/10)Mc^{2}$. Their sum is therefore zero: the density of the so-called `dark energy` is compatible with 7/10, so that dark energy is a
trivial false problem. As recalled above, Relativity is a local theory that does not apply in
cosmology at large: galaxies actually reach speed $c$, and, crossing the horizon, enter a Grandcosmos of
radius $R_{GC}$, given, as a first approximation, by the symmetrical holographic relation, this time
monochrome instead of the monoradial relation above:
\begin{equation}
S_{BH}\, = \pi(R/l_P )^{2} = 2\pi R^{(0)}_{GC} /l_{P}
\end{equation}
with $R^{(0)}_{GC} /R = l_{P} /\lambdabar_{M} \sim 10^{61}$. The conservation of the time constant $t = R/c = R^{(0)}_{GC} /C$ introduces a canonical velocity $C \sim 10^{61} c$, lifting the veil on an energy larger than that of the visible Universe by a factor of $10^{122}$, which can be identified with the $l_{P}$ - normalised quantum energy of vacuum, checked by
the Casimir effect \cite{Duplantier}. The central problem of quantum cosmic physics is thus solved. Moreover, the
objections against the Hawking approach using trans-Plankian frequencies are wiped out \cite{Damour}.

In a better approximation, justified below, $R$ is replaced in the above relation by $R^{\prime} = 2\hbar^{2}/Gm_{N}^{3}
\approx 18.105$ Gly, where $m_{N} = am_{e}$ is the Nambu mass, of central importance in particle
physics. Indeed, the half radius $R^{\prime}/2$ has a simpler definition than $R/2$: it corresponds to the
elimination of $c$ between the classical electron radius and the Planck length \cite{Sanchez1}. In this way, the sphere
of radius $R^{\prime}$ appears as the spherical hologram representation of the outer Grandcosmos:
\begin{equation}
S^{\prime}_{BH}\, = \pi(R^{\prime}/l_{P})^{2} = 2\pi R_{GC} /l_{P}
\end{equation}
This value will be dramaticaly confirmed in the section 5 (Fig.6).

Assuming the Toponic Quantification Hypothesis, the mass of a particle is an exact sub-multiple
of the mass-equivalent $M$ of the visible Universe: $m = M/N_{m}$, and its canonical wavelength is $N_m \lambdabar_{M}$,
allowing the following holographic extension of the above mono-radial holographic conservation:
\begin{equation}
S_{BH} = \pi(R/l_{P})^{2} = 2\pi R/\lambdabar_{M} = 2\pi N_{m} R/\lambdabar_{m}
\end{equation}
This series of diametral circles generate, by scanning, the approximation of a sphere: one thus passes
from disk to sphere. Note that this justifies the factor $\frac{1}{4}$ in above BH entropy. But, for
the approximation to be sufficient, \textit{the numbers $N_{m}$ must be very large}. In this way, the Cosmos-
Computer can use the computational properties of the mathematical constants of the continuous
analysis, such as $e$ and $\pi$ (See Section 4 and Discussion).

The immensity of the Cosmos thus receives a computational holographic explanation, which is much simpler
than that of standard cosmology, where initial conditions, during Planck's time, would be adjusted with
extreme precision, even with inflation. 

With $N_{Ed} = 136 \cdot2^{256}$ the Eddington's large number, one observes that $N_{Ed}$ times the neutron mass, corrected by the ratio $H/p$, central in Section 4, gives, to 41 ppm the effective mass $3M/10$, so that:
\begin{equation}
Mm_p = m_P^4/m_em_H\approx(10N_{Ed}/3)m_Hm_n 
\end{equation}
showing a kind of symmetry between the masses of particles .
This directly involves Planck's mass $m_{P}$, which at the present time, has no known interpretation, except
that it is close to the mass of the human ovocyte \cite{Sanchez1}. In this way, the local inertia is related to the distant
masses, in accordance with the Mach principle, which the relativity theory does not explain.
Another shortcoming of this theory is that it does not define any inertial frame. However, the
Doppler assymmetry of the cosmic background indicates that the speed of our local group of galaxies is about
630 km/s. The cosmic background is therefore tied to the Newton absolute frame, the Grandcosmos.

The mathematical continuity is excluded by the above Computation Principle, so the time associated
to the above 'topon' 
\begin{equation}
t_M = \lambdabar_{M} /c = \hbar/Mc^2 \approx 1.33 \times 10^{-104}s 
\end{equation}
is the new candidate for the `Chronon`, the `quantum of time`, so the
oscillatory bounce has a frequency about $10^{104}Hz $ \cite{Sanchez2}.

\section{The Tachyonic Flickering Space-Time-Matter}

The tachyonic hypothesis is consistent with the non-local character of quantum mechanics. The
matter-antimatter flickering respects the CPT (Charge conjugation-Parity inversion-Time reversal) symmetry.

\subsection{The Single Electron Cosmology}

The single-electron cosmology \cite{Sanchez1} uses the electron indeterminacy, which is the real basis of the
Exclusion Principle, giving an horizon value $R_1$ only dependent of the Hydrogen radius $a^{\prime} = aH/p$, by respect to $\lambdabar_e$. 
It is the value for which the mean cosmic value is also the atomic one:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sum(1/n)}{\sum(1/n^{2})} = a^{\prime}
\end{equation}
with the sum running from 2 to $R_{1} /\lambdabar_{e}$. This implies:
$$
R_{1} = \lambdabar_{e} exp((\pi^{2} /6 - 1)a^{\prime} + 1 - \gamma) \approx 15.77465 ~ Gly
$$
very close (0.4 ppm) to the following expression, where $p_{G} = P/2^{127/2}$, $\beta = (H - p)^{-1}$ is the
Rydbergh correction factor and $p_{0} = 6\pi^{5}$ is the Lenz-Wyler value $p$ (Section 4):
$$
R_{1} = ( p_{G} /p_{0} )(\beta R R^{\prime})^{1/2}
$$
Moreover, there is a direct connexion with the Grandcosmos radius and the Topon, to 0.90 \%:
\begin{equation}
R_1^3/R_{GC}^2 \approx \lambdabar_M  
\end{equation}
this will be of paramount importance in section 7.3

With the Kotov length $l_{K} = ct_{K}$ (see below), one notes that $(R/a_w l_K)^{1/2} $ is close to $\sqrt{a}$, while
the replacement of $R$ by $R_{1}$ is about $4\pi$, the canonical form for $\sqrt{a}$, the deviation being compatible
with $p/p_{0}$:
$$\sqrt{(R_{1} /a_{w} l_{K})} \approx 4\pi p/p_{0} \leftrightarrow t_{K} \approx 9 600.591445 s$$ a relation independent from $G$. 

This $t_K$ value will be confirmed, in the ppb range, by the value
deduced from $t_{K} /t_{e} = (a_{G} a_{w})^{1/2}$, see below, using values of $a_{w}$ and $a_{G}$ connecting, again in the ppb
range, with $\Gamma$, the Atiyah Constant (section 4.5).

From the Holographic two-step interaction \cite{Sanchez1}, it was deduced that the Kotov period is
associated with the photon mass. With the above value, it is $m_{ph} = \lambdabar/c^{2} t_{K} \approx 1.222 \times 10^{-55}$ kg, and the graviton mass is: 
$m_{gr}\, = m_{ph} /a_{w} \approx 3.722 \times 10^{-67} $kg.
The ratios with electron mass (Fig.1) corresponds respectively to n = 24 and $n = \Gamma$, the Atiyah constant, see Section 4.8, while the ratio $M/m_{ph} \approx (3/e)O^2_M$, to 0.1\%, with the cardinal order $O_M$ of the Monster group.

\subsection{The Cosmic Coherent Oscillation (CCO)}

The Kotov non-Doppler cosmic oscillation \cite{Sanchez1} is not considered seriously, since it seems to
violate the most basic prerequisite of physics, the generality of Doppler phenomena. Interpreting
this as a tachyonic phenomena, we identified the Kotov period $t_{K} \simeq 9600.06(2) s$, taking the electron
characteristic time $t_{e} = \lambdabar_{e} /c$ as unit, to the simplest relation eliminating $c$ between $a_{G}$ and $a_{w}=
\hbar^{3} /G_{F} m_{e}^{2} c$, the well measured $(10^{-7})$ dimensionless electroweak coupling constant $a_{w}$ :
\begin{equation}
t_{K} / t_{e} = (a_{G} a_{w})^{1/2}
\end{equation}
The weak coupling constant \cite{Carr} $a_{w} = (E_{F} /m_{e} c^{2} )^{2}$ is defined from the Fermi energy 
$
E_{F} \approx 292.806161(6) GeV \approx 573007.33(25) m_{e} c^{2}
$, itself tied to the weak force constant 
$
G_{F} \equiv (\hbar c)^{3} /E_{F}^{2} \approx
1.4358509(7) \cdot 10^{-62} Joule \cdot m^{3}
$
. This introduces the product of two area speeds, confirming the
flickering hypothesis:
\begin{equation}
(\lambdabar_{e}^2/t_{K} )(\hbar/(m_{p} m_{H})^{1/2} = (GG_{F})^{1/2}
\end{equation}
so the best measured cosmic quantity, the Kotov period, implies a symmetrization between
gravitation and weak nuclear force. This specifies the $G$ value to $10^{-6}$ precision (ppm). It is
compatible with the well-elaborate $(10^{-5})$ BIPM measurement \cite{Quinn}, at several sigmas from the Codata
value \cite{Tanabashi}, but the later is the mean between discordant measurements.
Computer analysis shows that this value of $G$ is compatible with the following well-defined value, with $d_{e} \approx 1.001159652$ the relative electron magnetic moment :
$$\begin{array}{ll}
(2^{127} /a_{G} )^{1/2} \approx d_{e} (H/p)^{3} \\
\qquad  \qquad \Leftrightarrow \\
G \approx 6.6754552 \times 10^{-11} kg^{-1} m^{3} s^{-2} \\
\end{array}$$
This value will be confirmed, in the ppb range, in Section 4.

\subsection{The omnipresence of CC0 in astrophysics}

With $t = R/c$, the relation $(t t_{K}^2)^{1/3} \approx 10.8$ years, compatible with the famous 11 years sun period
was noted. It was proposed that this unexplained phenomena, responsible for moderate periodic
climate variation, was also of flickering cosmic origin \cite{Sanchez3}. This hypothesis has been recently
confirmed by the straight temporal profile of the phenomena, showing it is tied to a quantum
process \cite{Kotov2}.

Remarkable enough, a `mysterious` period $\approx 1/9$ days of the Sun's pulsations has been predicted
long before its actual discovery in 1974. Namely, 73 years ago, French amateur astronomer Sevin
(1946) claimed that « la p\'{e}riode propre de vibration du Soleil, c'est-a-dire la periode de son infra-son (1/9 de jour), a jou\'{e} un role essentiel dans la distribution des plan\`{e}tes sup\'{e}rieures». Presumably,
the Sevin's «vibration period» of the Sun was merely an issue of his reflections about resonances
and distances inside the solar system. Nevertheless, solar pulsations with exactly that period were
discovered, after decades, - and independently of the Sevin's paper, - by a few groups of
astrophysicists. Soon the presence of the same period, or timescale, was found in other objects of
Cosmos too \cite{Kotov1}.

Opponents emphasize often that $t_{K}$ is very close to the 9th harmonic of the mean terrestrial day: the corresponding ratio - of the length of a day to the $t_{K}$ period - is equal to 8.99943(1), - and claim
thus the $t_{K}$ oscillation of the Sun should be regarded as an artifact (see, e.g., Grec and Fossat, 1979;
Fossat et al., 2017). As a matter of fact, however, the $t_{K}$ period occurs to be the best commensurate
timescale for the spin rates of all the most massive and fast-rotating bodies of the solar system, in
general.

This is obvious from Fig. 2, which shows the resonance spectrum $F( \nu )$, calculated for 15
motions of 12 largest, fast spinning, objects of the system (with the mean diameters $\geq 500$ km and
periods inferior to 2 days: six planets, three asteroids and three satellites, leaving apart trans-neptunian
objects; see Kotov, 2018). The peak of the best commensurability corresponds to a period of
9594(65) s, which coincides well, within the error limits, with $t_K$ at about $5.3 \theta$ C.L., i.e. with a
chance probability $10^{-7}$.

It seems very puzzling also that the spatial scale $l_{K} \approx 19.24$ A.U. occurs to be the best
commensurate with orbital sizes of the main planetary orbits of the solar system, - see Fig. 3,
where the resonance spectrum $F( \nu )$ is plotted for 11 orbits, including those of asteroid belt, Pluto
and Eris (orbital «diameters» were approximated by the major axes, and for the inner orbits they
were multiplied by $\pi$). The primary peak - of the best commensurability - corresponds to the
spatial scale 9600(120) light sec., or 19.24(3) A.U., at $4.7 \theta$ C.L. (Kotov, 2013).

Close binaries are characterized by the $t_{\Theta}$ resonance too, with the $\pi$ number as a factor of ideal
incommensurability of motions, or frequencies (Kotov, 2018). Fig. 4 shows the resonance spectrum,
or metrics of motion, $F_{1} (\nu) \equiv F(\pi \cdot \nu/2)$, computed for 5746 close binaries, including cataclysmic
variables and related objects. The major peak, with C.L. of about $7 \theta$, corresponds to the timescale
9590(70) s, coinciding within the error limits with $t_{K}$ (the stellar data were taken from all available
binary stars catalogues and original papers).

To compute the $F_{1} (\nu)$ spectrum, the program finds - for each test frequency $\nu$ - deviations of
ratios $(2\nu_{i} /\pi \nu) k \geq 1$ from the nearest integers, and determines then the least-square minimum of such
deviations. Here $\nu$ is the test frequency, $\nu_{i}$ minus the frequency of a given object, i = 1, 2, ...N - the
ordinal number, with N, the total number of observed periods in a sample of objects, and the power
k = 1 or -1. The factor of two in Eq. (2) takes into account that second half of the orbit repeats the
first one, and the transcendental number $\pi$ appears as a factor of orbital stability, or «ideal»
incommensurability, of motions, or frequencies (the $\pi$ number, in fact, characterizes geometry of
space; for details see Kotov, 2018).

Recently it was shown, that the $t_K$ timescale characterizes, statistically, the motion of superfast
exoplanets too, see Figure 5.

It was shown in fact, that a number of superfast, with periods inferior to 2 days, exoplanets revolve
around parent stars with periods, near-commensurate with timescales $t_{1}$ and/or $2 t_{1}/\pi$, where $t_{1} =
9603(85) s$ agrees fairly well with the period $t_{K} \approx 9600$ s of the so-called «cosmic oscillation», found
firstly in the Sun, then - in other variable objects of the Universe (the probability that the two
timescales would coincide by chance is near $3 \cdot 10^{-4}$).

at nearly $3.9\theta$ significance (after Kotov, 2018).}
\label{fig:figure_label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Tifft, Arp and Pioneer effects}

Another unexplained effect is the 75(5) km/s periodicity in the galactic redshift \cite{Tifft}. Now, this
speed corresponds to the quantum resonance $$\nu_{n} = nv_{1} =n\hbar /r_{e} m_{F} $$ where $r_{e} = \lambdabar_e/a$ is the electron classical radius and $m_{F} = m_{e}\sqrt{a_{w}}$ is the Fermi mass, close to the mean DNA nucleotide mass \cite{Sanchez1}.

The Halton Arp observations of chains of galaxies with different redshifts \cite{Arp} was also
rejected. But it could be the sign of the galactic regeneration constantly maintaining the visible
Universe mass: this is confirmed by the following confirmation of the invariance of the mean mass
density $\rho_{c}$.

Much controversial is the Pioneer deceleration \cite{Nieto} $$g_{Pi} \approx 8.7 \times 10^{-10} ms^{-2}$$ It corresponds to
the Pioneer time $$t_{Pi} = c/g_{Pi} \approx 3.4 \times 10^{17} s $$ close to $$t = R/c \approx 4.3587 \times 10^{17} s $$ The following section will show a connexion between the Kotov, Tifft and Pioneer effects.

\section{The Logic of Prospective Dimensional Analysis}

Physical relations use principally physical quantities of the type $Q = M^{x} L^{y} T^{t}$, where
the three categories, $M$, $L$ and $T$ are Mass, Length and Time measurements, and where the exponents are
rational numbers. However, the addition of measures of different categories has no significance.
This seems at first sight illogical, since, fundamentally, a product is a sum of additions. So, \textit{there
must be a hidden common nature for the three categories, mass, length and time}. This sustains the
above single electron cosmic model \cite{Sanchez1}. Moreover, this mimics the Fundamental Principle of
Arithmetics, founded on prime numbers, but limited to the three $M$, $L$ and $T$ categories. 

Indeed, with $t =
R/c$, summing the square of $ln(M^{\prime}/m_{e} )$, where $M^{\prime} = R^{\prime} c^{2} /2G$ is the critical mass in the above
holographic sphere representing the Grandcosmos, and the square of $ln(R/\lambdabar_{e} ) = ln(t/t_{e} )$, one gets, to 40 ppm:
\begin{equation}
ln^{2} (M^{\prime}/m_{e} ) + ln^{2} (R/\lambdabar_{e}) + ln^2 (t/t_{e} ) \approx ln^2 (R_{GC} /\lambdabar_{e} )
\end{equation} which traduces in function of $P = m_P/m_e$ by:
\begin{equation}
ln^2(P^4/a^3) + 2 ln^2(P^2/pH) \approx ln^2(2P^5/a^6)
\end{equation}
Moreover, to $10^{-7}$, corresponding to $7 \times 10^{-6}$ precision on the above G value:
\begin{equation}
ln^2(P^4/a^3) + 2 ln^2(P^2/pH) \approx exp(4e – 1/a)
\end{equation}
 
This is a dramatic geometrical confirmation (Fig. 6) for the visible Universe – Grandcosmos holographic couple, confirming the B.I.P.M. measurement of $G$ \cite{Quinn}.


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5cm,height=6cm]{./figures/triaxis.png}
\caption{Geo dimensional Universe-Grandcosmos couple. In a 3D Super-space, natural logarithms of length, time and mass ratios are considered as vectors. The logarithm of ratio of Grandcosmos radius by the Compton electron wavelength appears as the norm of the vector using for length and time projections a common ratio, that of the Hubble radius by the electron Compton wavelength, and for mass ratio that of $M^{\prime}$ by the electron mass. $M^{\prime}$ being the critical mass in the Grandcosmos reduced spherical hologram, this is a dramatic geometrical confirmation of the Extended (2D-1D) Holographic Principle applied to the Bekenstein-Hawking Universe entropy. The Grandcosmos existence cannot be denied since the relation between $e$, $a$ and involved logarithms reach precision $10^{-7}$.} 
\end{figure}

Another crucial point in Physics is the existence of invariant fundamental constants. Thus,
association of three of them must give characteristic values of $M$, $L$, $T$. So, approaching a domain in
Physics necessitates to calculate characteristic values ($M, L, T$), from the three universal constants
which are the most pertinent in the considered domain. This Prospective Dimensional Analysis is
largely used in Fluid Mechanics, were the equations are intractable, but is largely ignored in other
domains, because there is no real mathematical foundation, apart the above essential remarks, except for the triplet $c, G, \hbar$ which define the above Planck units. 

But, in virtue of the above Hierarchy Principle, the lack of theoretical justification is not a reason to
neglect Prospective Dimensional Analysis. 

The elimination of $c$ in the above $R$ formula means that the simplest basic dimensional
analysis starting from $\hbar$, $G$ and $m$, the Electron-Proton-Neutron mean mass, gives a good
approximation for $R/2$. Indeed, in the Hypothesis of a coherent Cosmos, it is logical to discard $c$
which is far two small a speed. This has not been observed during one century, since $c$ is always
believed to be the single mandatory foundation of space-time. The warning of Poincar\'{e}, the true
discoverer of Relativity: `use 4D space but do not confound Space and Time` has long been
forgotten, and physicists have unwisely put $c = 1$ in their equations.

In his three first minutes of cosmology, the first author obtained the length:
\begin{equation}
l \{\hbar,G,m\} = \hbar^{2} /Gm^{3} \approx R/2
\end{equation}
but it took 9 years to nurture this publication \cite{Sanchez3}, and it appeared later \cite{Sanchez1} that $m$ must be considered more precisely as the cubic root of the product 
$
m_{e} \cdot m_{p} \cdot m_{H}$

Moreover, the above critical condition
links the time $t = R/c$ and the mean mass density by the $c$-free formula:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{c} = 3/8\pi Gt^{2} \approx 9.41198 \times 10^{-27} kg \cdot m^{-3}
\end{equation}
Thus, the mainstream idea of a temporal variability of the mean density $\rho_{c}$ cannot be to
sustain, meaning that $\rho_{c}$ must be considered as a fundamental constant. This writes:
\begin{equation}
t\{\hbar,\rho_{c} ,G\}\, = 1/\rho_{c}^{1/2} G^{1/2} = (R/c) (8\pi/3)^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
This idea of $\rho_{c}$ being a fundamental constant permits to define $R$ without any ambiguity: this is the 
radius of the sphere containing critical mass. This means each atom is the center of an equivalent black hole,
justifying the above application of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. 

Opponents would say that the
center of a black hole presents a singularity: that is indeed the case in the above flickering Space-
Mass-Time hypothesis. Other will argue that the flying galaxies cannot reach the celerity $c$ at
horizon, but it must be recognized that Relativity is a local theory, so do not apply to cosmology at large.
Indeed, even General Relativity in unable to define what is a Galilean frame, while the Foucault
pendulus shows it directly, realizing the Cosmic Microwave Background frame, identified with the
Grandcosmos frame, as seen above.

Introducing the Fermi constant $G_{F}$, the associated $c$-free length is very particular, to $1.7\%$:
$$l\{\hbar,\rho_{c},G_{F}\} = \hbar/\rho_{c}^{1/2} G_{F}^{1/2} \approx 9.07154 \times 10^{9} m \approx \lambdabar_{e}^{2}/l_{P}$$
Now, the following mandatory $c$-free times are close to each over $(0.7\%)$:
\begin{equation}
T\{\hbar,\rho_{c} ,G_{F} \}\, = \hbar^{4} /\rho_{c}^{3/2} G_{F}^{5/2} \approx 5.4829 \cdot 10^{57} s
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
T^{\prime}\{\hbar,G,m\} = \hbar^{3} /G^{2} m^{5} \approx 5.5224 \times 10^{57} s
\end{equation}
One would conceive it as the periodic time of a Super-cycle, which matches with Topological Axis at n = 30,
the holic dimension (see below), to 4\%. Comparing $T$ with the Kotov Non-Doppler Cosmic
Oscillation period $t_{K} \approx 9600.60(2)$ s, one observes, to $0.04\%$:
$$T/t_{K} \approx O_{M} /\sqrt{2}$$
where $O_{M}$, the cardinal order of the Monster Group, have been detected in the Section 2.3.1, again in relation with the Kotov period. Eliminating the later, this introduces the above $t_0$ chronon :
\begin{equation}
T/t_0 \approx (3/e\sqrt{2})O_M^3
\end{equation}
The simplest interpretation follows: this is the number of quantum events in a Super-cycle of period $T$, in a perfectly deteministic Cosmos. 

The  Monster  Group,  the largest of 26 sporadic groups, is suspected by some researchers to play a central role in Physics: indeed string theory allows a bridge between apparently no-connected mathematical theories \cite{Borcherds}. see below the dramatic properties of $O_M^3$.

Introducing the above Pioneer abnormal deceleration $g_{Pn}$, one gets the time: 
$
t\{G, m_{e} , g_{Pn} \} = (Gm_{e} /g_{Pn}^{3} )^{1/4} = (t_{Pn}^{3} t^{\prime}_{e} )^{1/4}
$, where $t_{Pn} = c/g_{PN}$ and $t^{\prime}_{e} = Gm_{e} /c^{3}$ . This time is compatible with:
\begin{equation}
t\{G, m_{e} , g_{Pn} \} = t_{K} /(F/a)^{2}
\end{equation}
where the above Tifft factor $F/a$ appears. The implication of the time 
$t^{\prime}_{e}\, = Gm_{e} /c^{3} = 2.2568 \times 10^{-66} s$
confirms the above Planck's wall breakdown.

\section{The Arithmetical Logic: Holic Principle}

In the hypothesis of an Arithmetic Cosmos, the ultimate equations must be diophantine. The
simplest one is $T^{2} = L^{3}$, where $T$ is a time ratio and $L$ a length one, resolved, since 2 and 3 are 
co-prime, by $$T^{2} = L^{3} = N^{6}$$ where N is a whole number, meaning the classical 6D space of classical point mechanics. Considering the exponents, this particularizes the usual 3D space, but attribute 2 dimensions for the Time, in conformity with an independent study \cite{Bars}.

This is the degenerate arithmetic form of the spatio-temporal holographic principle.

This is also the 3rd Kepler's law, but its diophantine form gives $L = n^{2}$, the orbit law in the Hydrogen atom and in our
Gravitational Molecule model, where the visible Universe corresponds to the first orbital,
suggesting the existence of a Grandcosmos, as the Topological Axis does also, which favors the
dimension n = 30, the natural extension of the above:
\begin{equation}
T^{2} = L^{3} = M^{5} = N^{30}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is a mass ratio. Recall that the lifetime of an unstable particle depends on the 5th power of its mass. This holic dimension 30 is the touchtone of the Topological axis, from which gauge bosons are deduced by Cartan-Bott reductions [19] (Fig. 1)

This is called the Holic Principle, relating to the apparent world. The Complete Holic
Principle involves a field term $F^{7}$, and so introduces the dimension $30 \times 7 = 210$. It is confirmed by (to 15 ppm, 1.1 ppm, 56 ppm):
$$2/\delta \approx (R/\lambdabar_{e})^{1/210} \approx (1/2d_{e}) ln(pH)/lna \approx (1/d_e^{2})ln\tau/ln\mu$$
where appear the masses of the heavy leptons (Section 9.5). This implies a dramatic geo-combinatorial relation between $a$ and $p$ : $p^{p^{2}} \approx (a^{2})^{a^{3}}$ and confirms the central computational role of $\delta = R^{\prime}/R = pH/a^{3}$, which is to 1.6 ppm:$\delta \approx e^{2/e^2}$, confirming the central role of $e$ (section 9.1).

\section{The special holographic relations}
The holographic technique is by far the most efficient way to treat huge information \cite{Grosmann}, based on the
properties of a coherent wave. Now, the main lesson of modern physics is that everything (light \textit{and matter}) propagates by waves  (quanta appearing only at the detection). Moreover, a coherent wave is represented by a unitary matrix of quantum mechanism: it has been shown that the quantum formalism is very similar to the holographic one, describing an intreaction by a two-step holographic process. From these consideratiosn a mass for the photon (confirmed in section 4.1) and graviton has been proposed \cite{Sanchez1}, and are in definite places in the Topological Axis (fig. 1)

A Holographic Principle has been coined by some theoricians \cite{Bousso}, the name coming from the idea of dimension reduction, from 3D to 2D, similar to the visual impression in current visible holograms (in fact holography is only the 2D restitution of a propagating wave). It this respect, it is strange that no one tried to extend this process to 1D (an idea of temporal holography proposed in the author's thesis in 1975): this is the subject of Section 3, but using only the Planck length and the topon. It is natural to suppose that they are other holographic wavelengths. In fact \textit{the Topological Axis is the reunion of height 1D-2D holographic relations}. We present here three more significant examples. 

\subsection{The Conservation of Information}

The Grandcosmos holographic reduction radius $R^{\prime}$ shows itself an overwhelming holographic
relation with the CMB Wien wavelength $l_{CMB}$, to $0.01\%$:
\begin{equation}
4\pi(R^{\prime}/l_{CMB})^{2} \approx e^{a}
\end{equation}
Since the holographic technique uses coherent radiation, this seems incompatible with the CMB
thermal character. But \textit{in a totally deterministic cosmos, there is no paradox}. This question is
connected with the black hole information paradigm \cite{Preskill}. Independently of our approach, an
argument in favor of a total conservation of information was tied to a non-evolution cosmology
\cite{Nikolic}. 

Note that $e^{a}$ is also compatible with the half volume of the proton, with
the Planck length as unit.

So, while General Relativity and Unitary Quantum physics disagree about the nature of Space-Time, specially the non-locality phenomena, they agree for complete determinism, leading to the collapse of the
Copenhagen statistical interpretation. The hidden variables exist really: it is the Cosmos ! Heisenberg
relations would be only Fourier transform manifestations of Wave Mechanics.

\subsection{The Cosmic Temperature}

In the gravitational hydrogen molecule model, $R$ is defined by the following 1D-2D Special
Holographic Relation, using the wavelengths of the electron, proton and hydrogen, while the background wavelength appears in the 3D term involving the molecular Hydrogen wavelength:
\begin{equation}
2 \pi R/\lambdabar_{e} = 4 \pi \lambdabar_{p} \lambdabar_{H} /l_{P}^2 \simeq (4\pi/3)(\lambdabar_{CMB} /\lambdabar_{H2})^{3}
\end{equation}
The above relation gives $T_{CMB} \simeq 2.73 K$. With the measured temperature of the cosmic
background, there is a small gap compatible with $(H/p_G)^2 p/6\pi^5 $, where $p_{G}^{2} = P^{2} /2^{127}$ , with $P = \lambdabar_{e} /l_{P}$. 
This eliminates $l_{P}$, producing a relation independent of $G$, implying $T_{CMB} \approx 2.725820805$ Kelvin:
$$2^{127} = 2\pi^{2} \lambda_{CMB}^{3} /\lambdabar_{e} \lambdabar_{H}^2$$
which is the area of the 4-sphere of radius $\lambda_{CMB} / \lambdabar_{m}$, where $\lambdabar_{m} = (\lambdabar_{e} \lambdabar_{H}^2)^{1/3} $ proving the relevance of
the Lenz-Wyler approximation for the Proton/Electron mass ratio $p = 6\pi^{5}$, (see Section 9.2). Recall
that $2^{127} - 1$ is the most famous prime number in the history of Mathematics, being the last term of
the Combinatorial Hierarchy \cite{Sanchez1} of special imbricated Mersenne numbers 3, 7, 127, the sum of which is 137.

\subsection{The Holic Principle and Cosmic Coherent Oscillation}

While the HB entropy of the sphere of radius $R^{\prime} = 2r_e^3 / l_P^ 2$, where $r_e = \lambdabar_e /a $ is the electron classical radius, which is the holographic reduction of the Grandcosmos (section 3), verifies the relation:
\begin{equation}
\pi(R^{\prime}/l_P)^2 = (pi/2)(R^{\prime}/r_e)^3 
\end{equation}
with a wrong geometric coefficient, the HB entropy of the visible Universe shows a nearly geometric term, with imprecion $\sqrt{4/3\delta} \approx 0.17$:
\begin{equation}
\pi(R/l_P)^2 \approx (2\pi/3)(R/r_e)^3 
\end{equation}
which is an holographic conservation concerning \textit{the half-sphere of the visible universe}. By analogy with the above scanning process filling the whole sphere (section 3), the above Kotov length $l_k$ (section 4.3) permits to introduce two holographic relations, involving the whole sphere (0.90 \% and 2.6 \%):
\begin{equation}
\pi(R/l_K)^2 \approx 2\pi l_K/r_e 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
(4\pi/3)(R/l_K)^3 \approx 4\pi (r_e/l_P)^2 
\end{equation}

The deviation of Eq. (28) is very close to that of Eq.(10), inducing, to 17 ppm and 13 ppm: 
\begin{equation}
 (R_{GC}l_P/Rr_e)^2 \approx (R_1l_K/Rr_e)^3 \approx \mu^{35}(p/H)^2/ln2
\end{equation}
showing a holic form, involving the Muon/Electron mass ratio $mu$ (see section 9.5).
Taking account of the identity: $2l_P^2 = \lambdabar_M R = (R^{\prime}r_e)^2/(R_GC)l_P)^2$, this leads to a number reduced in the ratio $\delta^3$, where the forth root shows the Koide constant $p_K$, characteristic of the two Heavy Leptons (Eq. 68) (17 ppm and 1.8 ppm) :
\begin{equation}
r_/\lambdabar_M \approx (R_1l_K/R^{\prime}r_e)^3 \approx (4\pi P/p_K)^4
\end{equation}
The above term $R_1l_K/R^{\prime}r_e$ is close to (1\%) $\sqrt{O_M} \approx 2a^2P$ (0.18 \%). The study of deviations shows the intermediate bosons ratios $W$ and $Z$, withy values specified to the ppb range in section 9.4, leading to (-4 and 3.5 ppm):
\begin{equation}
O_M (FR^{\prime}/PR_1)^2 \approx W^4 (137/a)^3
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 (F^3R_1 / 2 a^3R^{\prime})^2 \approx Z^4 (a/137)(p_0/p)^2
\end{equation}
Thus, (0.3 and -0.4 ppm)
\begin{equation}
137 p_0 W^2 Z^2/p a_w^2 \approx \sqrt{O_M}/(2a^2 P) \approx e^{-4a}
\end{equation}
this precises a known relation in Particle Theory.

\subsection{The Eddington's constant 137}

The initial Eddington's proposal for $a$ was the whole number 136, as the number of independent parameters in the symmetric matrix $16 \times 16$. Note that \textit{n = 16 is the central dimension of the Topological Axis}. Later, one unity was added, becoming 137, a number which intrigued many physicists for a century, but apparently nobody highlighted it has a fundamental mathematical property: it appears as a Singular Prime in the series of the maximal primes appearing in the numerator of the harmonic
series: 3,11,5,137,7,11, showing a symmetry between the 11 dimensions of M theory (a synthesis of five string theories) and the 4 of space-time. Indeed: $137 = 11^{2} + 4^{2}$, while, as seen above:$11/4 = (\lambda_{CNB}/\lambda_{CMB})^{3}$

Since Riemann series are tied to the prime number distribution, it seemss odd and incredible that mathematicians
have not point out the primes appearing in the harmonic series, since it is the single pole. It seems
that the basic precept `all occurs in the pole` was forgotten in this case. 

As ancient Egyptians used only fractions of type $1/n$, they were certainly aware of this particular harmonic series: 
$S_{5} = 137/60$
Indeed it appears in the Ptolemaic approximation for $\pi$: $\pi_{Pt} = 377/120 = 2 +  S_{5}/2$.

Recall that the electrical constant $a$ characterizes the force $$F =\hbar c/al^{2}$$ between two l-distant
elementary charges, where $a$ appears central in Atomic Physics and in many fine-tuning relations \cite{Carr}. It is
misleading that physicists focused on one property only, the appearance of its fifth power in the
Hydrogen hyper-fine spectra, and call its inverse $\alpha$ the `fine-structure constant`. It is strange also that
Eddington's Theory was rejected as soon as $a$ appeared to deviate from 137. Indeed, the
following shows that 137 plays a central role in fine-tuning analysis. 

One may interpret 137 + 1 as
the sum of the numbers of dimensions in the Topological Axis \cite{Sanchez1}, taking into account the double
point (H atom-Pion couple) for the superstring value n = 10, and the remarkable sum:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=7}^{k=0}(2 + 4 k ) = 2^{7}
\end{equation}
So $137 = 2^{7} - 1 + 3 + 7$ the Combinatorial Hierarchy form \cite{Sanchez1}. But this appears also as 137 = 135 + 2,
with the dimension 2 of the String patent. In particular, one obtains the value $a \approx 137.035999119$
compatible with measurement $a \approx 137.035999139(31)$ in:
\begin{equation}
ln137/ln(a/137) \approx (2+135/d_{e})^{2}
\end{equation}
meaning the ratio $a/137$ acts as a canonical ratio. Indeed, the Bizouard constant $f$, precizing \cite{Sanchez1} the inverse of the standard 'strong coupling constant' 0.1184(7): $$f = a_w/2\pi(pH)^{3/2} \approx 8.43450$$ appears as a computation basis, in the following dramatic relations, to 0.3, 0.2, 0.7 \% and 22 ppb ! (confirmation of $G$ value):
$$(a/137)^F \approx 3^a \approx f^{f^2}/\pi \approx (O_B/f)^2 \approx P^4 (2/3)^a (p/p_0)^2 $$
proving that the base 3, \textit{the optimal whole number basis}, is also used by the Cosmos as well as $O_B$, the cardinal order  of the Baby Monster (as confirmed below). 
Note that while $R/\lambdabar_e \approx 2^{128}$, to 0.6 \%, $R^{\prime}/\lambdabar_e \approx 27^{27}$, with $27 = 3^3$ to 0.03 \%  Moreover, to 27 ppb:
$$ a/(a-1) \approx 3^{1/150} $$
Thus, the basis 3 makes a liaison between $a/137$ and $a/(a-1)$, very close (2 ppm) to the Bond factor 137/136, central in Eddington's theory \cite{Eddy}.

\subsection{The Atiyah and Sternheimer constants}
    Sir Michael Atiyah was a precurseur in the search for unity in Mathematics and Physics. His last work in this domain introduced the constant $$\Gamma = \gamma a /\pi$$ as a simplification term \cite{Atiyah1}. Indeed $\Gamma$ and the canonical $e^{\pi}$ enter the following dramatic simplification of the above (Section 4.1) single-electron cosmical formula (0.3 ppm):    
\begin{equation}
a = (p/H)((ln(R_1/\lambdabar_e) + \gamma – 1)/(\pi^2/6 - 1)) \approx ln(R/\lambdabar e) + \Gamma + e^{\pi}
\end{equation}
so confirming the $R$ value to 45 ppm, a correction which is $\beta p/p_0$, within 0.2 ppm.

Moreover, this confirms the central role of the Sternheimer scale factor $j = 8\pi^2/ln2$ (to 0.013 \%, 0.013 \% and 0.046 \%):
\begin{equation}
j \approx ln(R/\lambdabar e) + \Gamma \approx a - e^{\pi} \approx e^{\pi} lna
\end{equation}
It was noted \cite{Sanchez1} that $$j\approx T_{mam}/T_{CMB}$$ the ratio between mammal and cosmic temperatures, and that the mammal wavelength enters (1\%) $$(Rl_P)^{1/2}\approx hc/kT_{mam}$$ So, \textit{the couple thermal photon-Life is at the upper center of the Topological Axis}, while the down center is the Higgs boson (Fig.1). The real center, as seen above, is the dimension $n = 16$. Moreover, to 0.1\%, the water triple point enters: $$(R^{\prime}l_P)^{1/2}\approx hc/kT_{H2O}$$ which is also the product of triple points of Hydrogen and Oxygen, divided by the cosmic temperature. This shows that Chemistry is also involved \cite{Sanchez1}.

Now, the study of the 22 amino-acids \cite{Sanchez1} has shown that $j$ is a computation basis. Indeed, to 2\%: $j^{22} \approx 3 P^2 $ and, more precisely, to 0.01 \% :$j^{22} \approx Pp_E^7 $ where $ p_E \approx 1847.599459$ is the Eddington's mass ratio of the couple proton-electron, the roots ratio in the Eddington's equation $10x^2 - 136x + 1 = 0 $.

The last equation means the implication of $B = e^{e^{\pi}}$, the double exponential of $\pi$, in the ultimate theory. Indeed, to 0.3 ppm and 0.03 \% :
\begin{equation}
(\lambdabar_{CMB}/\lambdabar_e)^3 \approx F^5/6 \approx B^3/a
\end{equation}
It is also exhibited in the following holographic relation:
\begin{equation}
(4\pi/3) B^3 \approx \pi(F^3/a)^2,
\end{equation}
while $F^3/(44\pi)$ is close, to 0.01 \%, to the term $A = (3/2) a^7$, which enters the 'forgotten' electromagnetic power $E_e^2/\hbar A$, in the Hydrogen atom, with $E_e = m_ec^2$.
Note that, to 10 ppm and 2 ppm:
$
(H/n)^2(F^2/B)^3 \approx (4/3) a^2 \approx W/2\pi \beta^4
$
where $W$ is the W boson-Electron mass ratio (see Section 4). Now, to 30 ppm and 20 ppm :  
\begin{equation}
 (F^3/a)^2 \approx (P/FH^2)^3  \approx  (a/137)(4\pi/3)(F^2/p^{1/2})^3 
\end{equation}
Thus, the term $F^3/a$ seems special. More precisely, with the reduced Hydrogen radius $a^{\prime} = aH/p$, to 0.3ppm and 0.3 \%:
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\beta} F^3/a^{\prime} \approx (e/3)(e/2)^j  \approx (3/\pi) 4^{\Gamma}
\end{equation}
confirming that $j$ and $\Gamma$ are generalised dimension, i.e., as privileged exponents, calling for further study.

Note that (Fig 1.):
\begin{equation}
m_{e} c^{2} f(\gamma\Gamma) \approx 125.175 GeV
\end{equation}
seems compatible with the Higgs Boson energy, matching with the dimension index $k \approx \pi$, leading to $$\gamma\Gamma \approx (4\pi + 2) (p/d_e p_0)^2 $$ to 30ppb.
The length $\lambdabar_{e} f(\Gamma) \approx 5\times 10^{5}$ light-years is characteristic of a galaxy group radius, and $c$ times the Milankovich period. One observes also, to 0.16 \%, 1.8 ppm and 10 ppb:
$$e^\pi \approx (\Gamma - 2)/d_e \approx a_w^{1/f}/d_e^2 \approx (16/ln2)d_e \beta p/p_0$$
meaning that the special value in the Topological Axis $k = e^{\pi} /4 \approx 4/ln2$ corresponds to $n \approx \Gamma$.
One notes also, for the Pions mass ratios, in their 5 ppm uncertainty:
$$a/\pi\approx 496^2/137\Pi_0^{2/3} \approx p\beta^2/\Pi_+^{2/3}\approx (a/137)^{1/2} F^{10/3\sqrt{a}}$$
(1.8 ppm), confirming Atiyah's symmetry between $\pi$ and $a$, the role of the dimension 496, and the pertinence of the $20^{th}$ power of $F$, corresponding to the 20 normal amino-acids.  

\subsection{The ubiquity of $a^{a}$}
\markright{F.M. Sanchez,\ V.A. Kotov,\ M. Grosmann,\ D. Weigel,\ R. Veysseyre,\ C. Bizouard,\ N. Flawisky,\ D. Gayral,\ L. Gueroult, \textit{Back to Cosmos}}

From the Computation Hypothesis, $a$ must be an optimal basis, and, as seen above, 137 being is a number of parameters in the Eddington matrix, it must be interpreted as a dimension, a privilegied exponent. \textit{So the term $a^a$ must be central}.
    
Indeed, $a^a$, apart a $\pi$ factor, is the Grandcosmos volume with unit length the Hydrogen radius, to 0.4 and 0.5 \%:
\begin{equation}
(4\pi/3)(R_{GC}/r_H)^3 \approx a^a/\pi \approx 3(1/ln2)^{\sqrt{pH}}
\end{equation}
Note that the ln2 factor involves information theory.
Moreover, the dramatic relation $a^a\approx e^{p/e}$ has been connected with the fifth optimal musical scale (306 notes) and to the operational definition of $e$ \cite{Sanchez1}. Thus it seems interesting here to look for its manifestations in classical mathematics. 

The famous Lucas-Lehmer primality test uses the series of whole numbers $N_{n+1} = N_{n}^{2}-2$,
starting from $N = 4 = u_{3} + 1/u_{3}$ , with $u_{3} = \sqrt{3} + 2$, belonging to the Diophantine generators $u_{n} = \sqrt{n} + \sqrt{(n+1)}$, which entire powers are close to whole numbers. One shows that $N_{n} \approx u_{3}^{(2^{n})}$, and for n = 9:
\begin{equation}
u_{3}^{2^9} \approx (2(137^{2} + 48))^{64} \approx a^{a}
\end{equation}
defining $a$ to 39 ppm and showing that the Rydbergh term $2a^2$ plays a central role (see Eq.(33)).

Also, with the Pell-Fermat generator $u_{1} = 1 + \sqrt{2}$:
\begin{equation}
a^{a} \approx u_1^{3\times(2^{8}-1)}
\end{equation}
which defines $a$ to 0.3 ppm. So the number $a$ establishes a connexion between $u_{1}$ and $u_{3}$, two of the
simplest arithmetics generators. This opens a \textit{new research in pure mathematics}.

Remark that the $12^{th}$ Pell-Fermat number is $ u_1^{12}/2 \approx 140^2 + 1 \approx a(a+6)$ to 4 ppm. So, this comes back to the antique problem of the rationalisation of $\sqrt{2}$. Its correct value shows a $8^{th}$ fractional term very close to $\sqrt{5}$, so leading to $\sqrt{2}_a \approx N_{a}/D_{a}$, with $ N_{a} = 239 \sqrt{5} + 99 \approx \Gamma^{2}
\approx O_B^{1/12} $ and $ D_{a} = 13^2 \sqrt{5} + 70 \approx O_M^{3/61}$,
so connecting $O_M$ and $O_B$, since $61/2 \approx F/a^{2}$ to 0.04 \%, and introducing the next section.

\subsection{The intervention of Sporadic Groups}

The above term $O_M^3$ appears in (0.08\%, 2.5\%,1\%, 2\% and 61 ppm):
\begin{equation}
e^{137e}\approx (e/3)e^{ea}\approx O_M^3 \approx 496^{60} \approx fe^{16e^\pi} \approx f^{4d137/\pi}
\end{equation}
implying the Green-Schwarz string dimension 496, which is the third perfect number, after 6 and 28, and tied to the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson in the Topological Axis (Fig.1). The above Bizouard constant confirms it is a computation basis, and the above relation implies, to 61 ppm:
\begin{equation}
lnf\approx \pi e/4d_e
\end{equation}
The following combination of three main dimensionless parameters is remarkable: they are the electrical
one $a$, the Fermi ratio $F =\sqrt{a_{w}}$ and the strong Bizouard ratio $f$, to 0.05 \% and 0.13 \%:
\begin{equation}
F/af \approx 496\approx j^{\delta}
\end{equation}
Also, to 8 ppm: $$\ln(O_{M}) /2\ln\ln\ln\ln(O_{M}) \approx 137$$ and the product of the 20 groups of the happy family tied
to the Monster shows, to 0.015\%, 1\% and 0.9 \%:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{happy} \approx \delta \times a^{a} \approx j^{j^{\pi/3}} \approx (j/496)^2 \Gamma^{210}
\end{equation}
This confirms the above Complete Holic Principle, and the computation basis role of $\Gamma$ is moreover confirmed by, to 2\%: $$a^a \approx \Gamma^{209}$$ and the order of the Baby-Monster $$O_B\approx\Gamma^{24}$$ Now, from $209 = 137 + 3\times 24$:
\begin{equation}
O_B \approx (a/\Gamma)^{a/3}
\end{equation}
where $a/\Gamma = \pi/\gamma $ is the canonical Atiyah ratio.

The total product of the 26 sporadic orders $\Pi_{26}$ verifies, with n the neutron/electron mass ratio, to 1.8 ppm:
$$ \Pi_{26} \approx (9np_0/2p^2)(R_{GC}/\lambdabar_M )$$
Now $\Pi_{26}$ is close to $e^{4 \times 210}$, whose $a^{th}$ root is again very remarkable (65ppm, 98 ppm, 5 ppb):
\begin{equation}
e^{4 \times 210/a} \approx 2e^{2e} \approx H/4 \approx 26 \times (2 \times 26 + 1)/3
\end{equation}
The ppb range precision of the last term means clearly that a rationalisation of $e^{2e}$ is occuring, where the canonic dimension 26 plays a central role.

Note that, in Eq.(40), $j/496 \approx 0.229$ is close to the weak mixing angle, but $p/g_0 \approx 0.232$ is closer to the measured value 0.23116(12) \cite{Tanabashi}, where $g_0 = 7920 $ is the smallest Matthieu sporadic group order. These ratios appear as calculation basis in the product of cardinal orders of the Monster and the baby-Monster groups, to 1\%, 0.2 \%, 1 \% and 0.7\%:
\begin{equation}
O_MO_B\approx H^{2H/a} \approx (g_0/p)^a \approx (496/j)^{137} \approx \sqrt{2}(e496^2)^{15}
\end{equation}
confirming the central role of 496. Note also (0.1 \%) that $O_MO_B \approx  n_{ph}/\delta^{1/2}$, where $n_{ph}\approx (3/\pi) exp(e^6/2)$ (to 0.2 \%) is the photon number in the visible universe. 

From the Eqs (38), (42) and (44), by taking the $137^{th}$ root, one obtains, to 0.03 \%: $496/j \approx (ae^e/\Gamma)^{1/3}$
Now $ae^e/\Gamma$ is close to $2ed_e$. More precisely (0.7 ppm):
\begin{equation}
a/\Gamma = \pi/\gamma \approx 2d_e \times e (p_0/p)^2 
\end{equation}
Thus, \textit{the Atiyah symmetry infers a relation between the three mathematical constants $e$, $\pi$ and $\gamma$ and the Electron magnetic moment $2d_e$}. It is remarkable that this is obtained from singularities involving the two Monster groups. This introduces the next section.

\section{The Fine-tuning with basic mathematical constants}

Since some dimensionless physical parameters are very precisely measured, we looked for
relations with mathematical constants such as $e$, $\pi$ and $\gamma \approx
0.577215665$, the Euler-Mascheroni constant, which appears already in the above single-electron
cosmic radius and the Topological Axis.

\subsection {The optimal calculation base $e$ confirmed}

The Topological Axis shows clearly that the Grandcosmos is defined by the following conjunction (1\%):
\begin{equation}
f(k = e^{2}) = exp(2^{e^{2+1/2}}) \approx exp(e^{2e}+e^{2})
\end{equation}
where the supplementary term $exp(e^2)$ is close to $a^{3/2}$. Note these properies of the 'economic number', to 
0.4 \%, 6 ppm, 0.4 ppm,0.3, 0.04, 0.4, 0.2, 0.6 \%:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
%
\displaystyle
e^{e^e}\approx (lnp)^{lnp}  
\approx 137 (e^{e})^3 \approx e^e a \sqrt{pH} (p/p_0)^2 \approx j^6/F \\
\approx FlnD/ln(2\pi) \approx FlnF/2 \approx 2WlnZ \approx Zln(\lambdabar_{CMB}/\lambdabar_e) 
\end{array}
$$
Note that $e^2$ is the limit of the following musical series:
$$(3/2)^5 \approx (4/3)^7   \approx (5/4)^9  \approx  (6/5)^{11}  \approx   ...  \approx  (1+1/n)^{2n+1}  $$  
a series converging very much rapidly than the classical Euler's one $(1+1/n)^n$. The first two terms defines the occidental 12 tones scale.

The canonical ratio $R_{GC}/\lambdabar_M = 2P^9/a^6pH $ confirms the Extended Holographic Principle, to 0.04 \%:
\begin{equation}
R_{GC}/\lambdabar_M  \approx (137e/a)^{420}  
\end{equation}
exhibiting the following property (0.3 ppm):
 $$ (a/137)^{420} \approx (137 - 3)/120 $$  
with $137 - 3 = 7 + 127$ are the Combinatorial Hierarchy terms, 

\subsection {Lenz-Wyler's Formula}
Armand Wyler singularized a value approaching $a$ to 0.6 ppm and confirmed the pertinence
of the Lenz approximation which plays a central role above: $p_{0} = 6\pi^{5}$ approaching $p$ to 18.824 ppm.

A confirmation of a symmetry between $a$ and 137 is the following relation involving $H$, the
Hydrogen electron mass ratio, precise to 83 ppb:
$$a/137 \approx (p_0 H)^{1/2} /p$$
One observes that the rejection of Wyler's work, due to a non-perfect formula for the $p$ and $a$ values, is a new
manifestation of the general neglectance of the Principle of Hierarchy.

A confirmation of a symmetry between $a$ and 137 is the two following approximations for $p$ with the same imprecision 80 ppb, so leading to the ppb relation:
 $$p \approx (137/a) (p_0 H)^{1/2}  \approx EH^3/d_e^2jFD $$ 
where $D = 196883$ is the Moonshine Monster dimension \cite{Conway}, which appears also, to $10^{-7}$, to be $(\pi_p P/d_eF)^{1/2}/H$, with $\pi_p = (p/6)^{1/5}$, so confirming again the pertinence of Wyler's approach. 

Note also that the Lenz-Wyler formula is nothing but the product of the area by the volume of a cube with side $\pi $. If one consider a cube with side 5, privileging again the identification dimension = exponent, this gives $6 \times 5^5 = 137^2 - 19 $. This is not a chance coincidence, because this relation has long time been deduced from basic considerations on quarks \cite{Sanchez1}. Indeed with $u = 5 $ and $d = 6 $, the combination $uud = 150 $, which power 3/2 is close to $H$, while the combination $udd \approx (n/a)^2 $. This leads to (0.012 \%) $6\times 5^5 \approx (aH/n)^2 $  
Note that, with $q = 2^{12}$ to 0.03 \%, 2.5 \% and 41 ppm:
$$R_{GC}/\lambdabar_e \approx q\times 5^{137} \approx 6^{137}/q^2 \approx 6^{128}/(1+1/\sqrt2)$$
Since $R/\lambdabar_e \approx 2^{128}$, the decomposition of 6 leads to a natural Universe-Grandcosmos partition, and to the following approximation for the tachyonic celerity ratio (0.01\%) 
$$ C/c\approx3^{128} (p_K/p_G \delta)^2 $$ where $p_K$ is the Koide constant (see section 9.5). This confirms the role of the correspondance quark up = 5 and \textit{quark d = 6 with a double structure}. It is an example of \textit{immergence}, i.e. deducing the small from the large, in a striking similitude between cosmology and nuclear physics. Another example was encontered in section 2.4, where dimensional analysis gives the visible Universe radius, in an easier way than the equivalent one for the Hydrogen atom radius, since for this case there is no evidence that $c$ must be left out.
Elimination of $q$ leads to (2.6 \%):
$(R_{GC}/\lambdabar_e)^3 \approx 150^{137}$. 

In Atiyah's last work the Bernoulli function $x/(1-e^{-x})$ is used. This is the kernel of the thermal Planck law. Indeed, considering the Wien reduced constant $w = hc/kT\lambda_{Wien} = 5 (1-e^{-w}) \approx 4.965114245$, one notes that $a \approx e^w -2\pi$, suggesting $a$ to be a trigonometric line. Indeed $cosa \approx 1/e$, and, to 65 ppb:
\begin{equation}
a \approx 44\pi - Arccos(1/e)
\end{equation}
a formula largely diffused on the web, but without indication of its origin. Now $w^{e^w}$ enters (1 ppm):
$$w^{e^w+1} \approx \sqrt{ad\sqrt{n/p}}R_{GC}/\lambdabar_e $$
This confirms that the Planck thermal law will play a central importance in the future fundamental theory. 

\subsection {The Archimedes constant $\pi$ as a calculation base}
\markright{F.M. Sanchez,\ V.A. Kotov,\ M. Grosmann,\ D. Weigel,\ R. Veysseyre,\ C. Bizouard,\ N. Flawisky,\ D. Gayral,\ L. Gueroult,\textit{Back to Cosmos}}

The value of the Topological Function for the main String
 dimension 26 renders, to 0.1\%, the same Lenz-Wyler form $f(26) \approx 6(2\pi^{2} a^{3} )^{5}$, where $2\pi^{2}a^{3}$ is the area of a 4-sphere of radius $a$. Moreover, with $n/p$ the mass ratio Neutron/Proton, to 0/3\%, 0.02\% and 1ppm:
$$(p/n) (R/\lambdabar_{e})^{2} \approx (f(26)/6)^{2} \approx (2\pi^{2} a^{3})^{10} \approx \pi^{155}$$
The corresponding value of $\pi$ in the last expression shows the fractional series 3, 7, 16, -u, with $u \approx
2 \times 137$, confirming again the Rationalisation Hypothesis. This leads to the rational value
\begin{equation}
\pi_{R} = (355u-22)/(113u-7) 
\end{equation}
This corresponds to the above $G$ value to 10 ppb accuracy.
Since $(R/\lambdabar_{e})^{2}$ is also close to $2^{256}$, within 1\%, this illustrates the following musical relation involving again 137:
$$2^{1/155} \approx \pi^{1/256} \approx (2\pi)^{1/3 \times 137}$$
The scale with 155 notes is not known, but 137 appears also in the classical musical scales \cite{Sanchez1}. 

whole powers of $\pi$ appears in the 2 ppm Reilly formula: 
\begin{equation}
a \approx 4\pi^{3} + \pi^{2} + \pi \approx \pi^{9/2}2^{-1/3}
\end{equation}
and recall that whole powers of $\pi$ appears also in the even order Riemann series.

\subsection {The Four Forces Unification in ppb Fine-Tuning}
The Particle standard model achieved the unification between electromagnetism and weak nuclear force, with propositions for extension towards strong nuclear force in Grand Unification Theory (GUT), but no synthesis have been possible with gravitational force. The Topologocal Axis shows clearlty that GUT with $1O^{16}$ GeV gauge boson seems confirmed. However, in section 4.2, it is proven that the Kotov oscillation reveals a symmetry between two apparently inconciliable domains: electroweak and gravitational forces. So we look here for a precise relation involving the 4 force parameters, $a$ (electric), $a_w$ (weak nuclear), $f$ (strong nuclear) and $a_G$ (gravitation). The later force is equivalently represented by $p_G = P/2^{127/2}$, with $P = m_P/m_e$, which was admitted to be:
\begin{equation}
p_G = \sqrt{pH} (p/H)^3/d_e
\end{equation}
 With the Atiyah constant $\Gamma = \gamma a/\pi$ is (section 8.2), we first noted that, inside the 250 ppb indetermination:  
 $a_{w} = F^2 = (137 \times 2 \Gamma)^{3}$
 which affects the form of the simplest diophantine equation (section 6).
 Now $a_{w}$ is a cube: $a_{w} = (\lambdabar_{e}/l_{eF})^{3}$, with $l_{eF} = (G_{F}/m_{e} c^{2})^{1/3}$. Thus:    
\begin{equation}
\lambdabar/l_{eF} \approx 137 \times 2\Gamma
\end{equation}
leading to:
\begin{equation} 
F = a_{w}^{1/2} = E_{F} /m_{e} c^{2} \approx 573007.3652
\end{equation}
This relation is so striking that we ask the computer if it can find synthetic precise relations involving the other forces parameters, in function of $\pi$ and $\Gamma$. Indeed, with the neutron/electron mass ratio $n \approx 1838.68366089(17)$, the computer gives the following relation in the ppb range:
\begin{equation}
aF/\sqrt(pH) \approx \pi(4n/\Gamma)^3/p_G \approx \mu^2
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the Muon/Electron mass ratio, \textit{inside its 20 ppb indetermination}, so proposing the value:
\begin{equation}
\mu \approx 206.7682869
\end{equation}
Note that $n/\Gamma$ is close (3.4 ppm) to the monstrous $5^{th}$ term 292.6345909 in
the fractional development of $\pi$ which is itself very close to $n/2\pi$ to 3.4 ppm. Since the fractional
development of $\pi$ is to this date an unsolved problem, \textit{this confirms that current mathematics is
incomplete and that Nature uses rational approximations for $\pi$}.

These relations show a dual form, the first one without any numerical factor:
\begin{equation}
ap_{G} / \pi \sqrt(pH) \approx (n F/137^{2} \Gamma^{3} )^{3} \approx (4n/ \Gamma)^{3}/F
\end{equation}
Now, as was recalled above, the exponents represent the number of
dimensions. So, this represents a dimensional reduction, eliminating 137, from 9D and 6D to
3D, which could be associated with the superstring theory, where the equations are coherent only if space
has 9 dimensions, and if the 6 supplementary dimensions unfold on very small distances \cite{Polchinski}.
Note that the strong force parameter $f$ is represented by the Bizouard formula:
\begin{equation}
F/\sqrt(pH) \approx 2\pi fpH/F
\end{equation}
The following weak boson ratios $W$ and $Z$ match (Eq.1):
$R/\sqrt(\lambdabar_{p} \lambdabar_{H} ) \approx (WZ)^{4}$
\textit{in the ppb range}. For the charged boson: 
\begin{equation}
W \approx 137^{2} \Gamma / 3d_{e}
\end{equation}
This value is confirmed in the ppb range by:
\begin{equation}
\pi W^{14}/3 \beta \approx 496^7 O_M
\end{equation}
confirming the holic attribution (section 6) of power 7 for a field parameter, and the central role of the dimension 496.
\begin{equation}
Z \approx ap^{2} \pi^{4} / 137 d_{e} n
\end{equation}
confirmed by its ppb liaison with the Janko pariah group $J_3$
\begin{equation}
J_3 \approx 3\pi^2 Z^2 / (137^2 + \sqrt{1+d_e})
\end{equation}
This enligth a liaison between the monster and the $J_3$ cardinals, while these two groups have no known relations:
\begin{equation}
O_M \approx d_e J_3^7 \sqrt(p/p_0)
\end{equation}
\textit{The very existence of so precise ppb relations confirms there exists a Final Theory involvoing the sporadic groups}. The following section indicates additive hints.


\subsection {The Heavy Leptons Fine-Tuning}
The standard model is unable to explain why there are three famillies of particles. Thus, the study of the muon and tau mass ratios is crucial. Now, the following Koide relation \cite{Koide}, which has a mathematical justification in term of circulant matrix \cite{Brannen}, correctly predicted $\tau$ at an epoch (around 2000) during which its measurement was false to 3 $\sigma$. It can be wrote:
\begin{equation}
(1 + \mu + \tau)/2 = (1 + \sqrt\mu + \sqrt\tau)^2/3 = p_K
\end{equation}
This Koide constant, that no one noticed, $p_K \approx 1842.604994$ has been detected in Eq. (31), which means that, to 2 ppm (with an additive term at 0.16 ppm):
\begin{equation}
p_K^4 \approx (4\pi)^4 apH \approx (pH)^2 (137a/136(a^{\prime}-1) d_e
\end{equation}
With the above $\mu$ value, $\tau \approx 3477.441701$, a value which obeys, to 0.7 and -0.8 ppm:
\begin{equation}
e^{e^e}/a e^e \approx (F/137)^{3}/ (\mu\tau/j)^2 \approx  \sqrt{pH} (p/p_0)^2 
\end{equation}
resulting from the elimination of $a_m = \sqrt{137a}$ in the following extension of the above relation defining $\mu$, giving a central role to the Tifft ratio $F/137$, and so defining an Brout-Englert-Higgs ratio $s \approx 495.88^2$:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
%
\displaystyle
F/137 = f \sqrt{s} = \mu^2 \sqrt{pH}/a_m^2 \\ \approx a_m (p/p_0) \tau /j \approx a^{1/6}p_K \approx jp/50 
\end{array}
$$
(0.7 ppm, 0.3 \%, 0.1 \%. Moreover the $20^{th}$ power of this Tifft term $F/137$ is tied to the product $\Pi_{par}$ of the 6 pariah group orders (0.4 \% and 30 ppb):
$$ F/137 \approx \Pi_{par}^{1/20} \approx f O_M^{1/20}(a/137)^{1/10}\beta^{1/5}$$ 

 With the classical electron radius $r_e = \lambdabar_e/a$, $p_K$ enters Eq.(11) (0.5, 17 and 40 ppm):
\begin{equation}
r_{e}/\lambdabar_M \approx(4\pi P/p_K)^4 \approx (R_1l_K/R^{\prime}r_e)^3 \approx (es)^{15}/p^2  
\end{equation}
confirming the above BEH ratio $s$ and relying with the Monstrer orders product $O_MO_B/\sqrt{2}$ (see Eq.(44))

The above Koide constant $p_K$ connects also with the above Moonshine Monster dimension \cite{Conway} $D = 196883$, to 48, 10, 13, 26 ppm:
$$137/8 \approx p^2/D  \approx (p_K/2\pi)^{1/2} \approx 137^{1/\sqrt3} \approx p^{1/\sqrt7}$$

Moreover $\tau$ correlates with the
term $1+1/\sqrt{a}$, central in quantum electrodynamics to 0.1 ppm:
\begin{equation}
1+1/\sqrt{a} \approx \tau^{3} H/pD^{2}
\end{equation}
This Koide relation, quite discarded by the scientific community, is another sign of the serious incompleteness of present Particle Physics standard model

Note the double relation of $\mu$ and $\tau$ with $e$, to 0.01 \% and 0.06 \%:
\begin{equation}
ln\tau \approx 3e \approx a\mu/\tau 
\end{equation}
These numbers enters the following dramatic series, to 1 ppm, 56 ppm, and 13 ppm:
\begin{equation}
2/\delta = 2a^3/pH \approx ln(pH)/2d_e lna \approx (ln\tau/ln\mu)/d_e^2 \approx d_e^2 ln s/ln\tau
\end{equation}
where $s \approx (F/af)^2 \approx 496^2 $ is compatible with the mass ratio Brout-Englert-Higgs-Boson/Electron, corresponding to 125.6 GeV, and, in the Topological Axis to $k \approx \pi $, and $n \approx \gamma \Gamma$ (Fig. 1).

With $\delta^{\prime} = p_K^2/a^3 $, and the symmetrised Planck area $(l_P^{\prime})^2 = \sqrt{h \hbar} G/c^3$ (11, -11 ppm, and 0.04 \%):
\begin{equation}
\pi^{-1/2}(R_{GC}/l_P^{\prime})^4/ \approx (\delta^{\prime} O_M )^9 \approx (4\pi)^{1/2}  \mu^{210} \approx \tau^{137}
\end{equation}
The existence of a Final Theory based on the Holic Principle (section 6), the Grandcosmos and the Koide-Sanchez constant cannot be denied. The interpretation is clear: the 4D space-time in Grandcosmos is associated with a 9D space involving the Monster. \textit{This opens a path towards the Final Theory}. 


\section {Discussion}
\markright{F.M. Sanchez,\ V.A. Kotov,\ M. Grosmann,\ D. Weigel,\ R. Veysseyre,\ C. Bizouard,\ N. Flawisky,\ D. Gayral,\ L. Gueroult, \textit{Back to Cosmos}}

There is presently an intense debate in physics community. Only a minority believes in a Single
Final Theory, while a large majority have abandoned such hope and believes seriously in the extreme
consequence of the `Anthropic Principle`, the Multiverse conundrum. The present article settles the
debate in favor of a single steady-state cosmos.

This article confirms direct connexions \cite{Sanchez1} between physical and biological parameters. So,
while the `Anthropic Principle` states that Life implies a favored Cosmos among a Multiverse, the
`Inverse Anthropic Principle` \cite{Sanchez1} is more logical, stating that an all-deterministic single Cosmos
implies Life, in contradiction with the Darwin `accidental life` approach, a generally admitted so-
called `theory` with too much missing links \cite{Chauvin}. The fundamental hypothesis of
this article is that the Cosmos is like a computer. A common point with the brain is the multi-base
character, experienced in musical sensation. Thus, \textit{intelligent life must be universal}. The famous Fermi
question ` where are they ? ` is not a paradox, since any abnormal observation is \textit{a-priori} rejected by a
dogmatic community.

Another type of separation exists, but with not any debate: only a small minority thinks Physics
and Mathematics are unified, while a large majority separates the two domains (so separating also
Biology). The present article shows that the former are right: physical constants are mathematical
constants, so the present-day mathematics are still in infancy, not realizing that the discovery of
sporadic groups is a crucial discovery for physics. In particular, it is clearly shown that
Grandcosmos is like a computer which uses optimal physics-mathematics dimensionless constants as
calculation basis and that they are present in DNA characteristics \cite{Sanchez1}. The present article shows
definitely the liaisons with $e$, $\pi$ and $\gamma$, as well as very special rational approximations of 
them, and rehabilitates string theories, also abandoned by amajority \cite{Woit}.

There is also the Determinism separation, a majority believing seriously that `God plays dices`,
in contradiction with our Cosmic Computing Principle. The $c$-free analysis gives simply and
directly the Supercycle period of an all-deterministic Grandcosmos, as it gives in an elementary
calculation the visible Universe horizon radius, in a formula which was present for a century in
astrophysics text-books: the limit of a star radius when the number of atoms reduces to unity \cite{Sanchez1}.
This is tied to the application of the exclusion principle that Eddington dared to apply in
cosmology. For this reason he was declared as a `crakpot` and his theory discarded by a majority.
Fortunately, the large theoretical advance of Eddington is now recognized \cite{Larin,Durham}, but without
mentioning a crucial point: he predicted the tau fermion with a right order of mass, 30 years before its surprising discovery, calling it Heavy Mesotron \cite{Carr}.

The same rejection seems to apply now to Sternheimer 'scale wave' and Atiyah's last work. The present article shows that at least a part of these works is very pertinent.

It seems that the pre-scientific role of chance is a common point between three misleading views
in present mainstream thinking. Firstly, in biology, the assimilation of Darwin's rough argumentation
with a scientific theory. Secondly, in quantum physics, the so-called `uncertainty principles`, which are
only manifestations of the general wave propagation (Field and \textit{flickering} Matter), through Fourier
transform properties. Thirdly, in cosmology, the recurse to the Multiverse conundrum.

The pertinence of our simple polynomial relations cannot be admitted by the standard community, arguing for instance that since the proton is composite, its mass cannot enter simple relations. The same argument is presented for the theoretical dependence of the electric constant $a$ with other constants, or with the energy level. These are reductionist arguments, unable to explain the fine-tuning phenomena, and leading to the sterile concept of unexplained emergences. By contrast, the holistic approach implies the concept of \textit{immergences}, resulting from the ancestral idea that Cosmos simplicity is the real origin of everything. It is strange, and troubling, that this term \textit{immergence} is a neologism.

Finally, there is the problem of infinity. While it is welcome in mathematics, it is condemned in physics. The domination of the first blocked for years the quantum mechanics, but now it is admitted that everything is quantified. However, the continuum has the advantage that it simplifies formulas, by the virtue of the computation properties of $e$ and $\pi$. Thus, the vastness of the Cosmos is a compromise, but at the expense of rationalisation of $e$ and $\pi$. This have been shown in this article.

\section {Conclusions: Cosmic Simplicity at work}
\markright{F.M.Sanchez,\ V.A.Kotov,\ M.Grosmann,\ D.Weigel,\ R.Veysseyre,\ C.Bizouard,\ N.Flawisky,\ D.Gayral,\ L.Gueroult,\ \textit{Back to Cosmos}}

The application of the old direct scientific method, looking for fine tuning between physical
parameters leads to a return to the Perfect Cosmological Principle implying a Steady-state Cosmos,
confirmed by holographic relations. The standard cosmological principle was unduly limited to
spatial homogeneity. The relativity theory, unable to define an inertial frame, is a local one and do
not apply to Cosmology at large: the Absolute Space is reestablished, realized by the Microwave
Cosmic Background, which identifies with the Grandcosmos Frame, while Kotov period is an
absolute clock, the dephasage of coherent oscillations between deferent quasars being ruled by the tachyonic celerity.

The simplest topological equations, the equality between dimensionless topological varieties,
circumference, area, 3D volume... appear to apply in cosmology, which, for many, seems to be the hardiest
chapter of physics. This modern, negative, opinion is in fact in contrast with the ancient culture, for
which the Cosmology is the first of all science, so must be the simplest. In the original sens of the
word `revolution`, it is a return to the source of Science, the `all is whole number`, of Pythagoras.
Even the degenerate form of topological or holographic relations, the simplest diophantine
equations, the Holic Principle, shows direct pertinence. In particular it emphatizes the 30
dimensions, which appear decisive in the Topological Axis, and are identified with the sum of 26 string
dimensions and 4 of space-time.

The standard Holographic Principle must be generalized to wavelengths others than the Planck
length, in particular the Topon, the visible Universe wavelength in 1D holography, which breaks
another taboo of current thinking: the Planck wall, by an enormous factor, about $10^{61}$, resolving the
vacuum energy dilemma factor $10^{122}$.

The high precision of relations prove that the traditional scientific thinking is not at all baffled by
the physical parameter values, meaning they are mere mathematical constants. In this respect, the
high precision in the measurement of the Electric and Fermi constants, Proton, Neutron and Muon masses, Kotov cosmic period, and, with far lesser precision, background temperature, must be saluted as decisive achievements.

In particular, the simplest method of looking for simple monomial expressions leads to ppb correlations, confirming Cosmos Unicity. As Atiyah wrote \cite{Koide}: `Nobody has
ever wondered what the Universe would be if $\pi$ were not equal to 3.14159.... Similarly no one
should be worried what the Universe would be if $a$ were not 137.035999...` This is a definite
rejection of the Multiverse Hypothesis.

The present article confirms also the Topological Axis, which was obtained by the simplest
visualizing method to represent in a single figure the characteristic lengths in macro and micro-
physics, taking the electron wavelength as unity. \textit {the double logarithm representation was the simplest representation}

The pertinence of the Topological Axis confirms
the importance of the electron wavy propagation. This rehabilitates the string theory, including the
\textit{tachyonic} bosonic version, since the canonical dimension 26 appears to characterize the observable
universe radius $R$. This confirms that $c$ is not really a cosmic pertinent speed, as is clearly shown both by
logic (it is far too slow) and quantum non-locality.

Moreover, excluding $c$ from the simplest tool of elementary physics, the prospective dimensional
analysis, this gives immediately a very good approximation of both R/2, the cosmic temperature and the cosmic super-cycle periodicity, which connects with the holic dimension n = 30 in the
Topological Axis, whose apparent asymmetry suggests directly the existence of a Grandcosmos.

While it is claimed that String Theory do not connect with experiment, the Cartan-Bott periodicity
appears, unifying in particular the gauge bosons, so confirming the Standard Model of Particle Physics, but with
massive gluon, which is independently seriously considered \cite{Salingaros}.

This means also that the International System must go back to only three fundamental unities,
Mass, Length and Time. The distinction between Length and Time must be emphasized, as
Poincar\'{e}, the father of 4D Relativity Theory recommended. Indeed their confusion, by writing $c$ =
1, impeded the fact that the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre radius $R$ is a trivial length.

The simplest model, the gravitational Hydrogen molecule gives $R$, explaining the 2 factor and
justifying the elimination of $c$, as in the Haas-Bohr model. This corresponds to a Hubble constant 70.790
(km/s)/Megaparsec, consistent with the recent measurement \cite{Bonvin}: 72(3) Megaparsec/(km/s), which
confirms the direct novea measurement, but disagree (3$\sigma$) with the standard value.

The simplest statistical theory of Eddington gave another justification to $R$. Also, particularly
simple and elegant is the Large Eddington number, giving correctly the number of neutrons in the
trivial fraction 3M/10 of the observable universe, \textit{probably the most dramatic prediction in
 scientific history}.

The simplest proof of the computation basis character of the electrical parameter $a$ is provided
by the multiple appearance of the terms $e^{a}$ and $a^{a}$.

The great significance of a number of dimensions is the number of independent variables,
which is a fundamental invariant, whatever the theory \cite{Weigel}. So, it is logical to advance a
hypothesis that 26 physical parameters are defined by the 26 sporadic cardinal orders. Since
Sporadic Groups are associated with octonion algebra \cite{Atiyah2}, this rejoins a prediction of Atiyah's last
work, the essential role of octonion algebra in the final theory \cite{Koide}.

The problem of the stability of the solar system must be revisited, taking into account
seriously a cosmic influence, characterized by the Kotov's period and length. Also the Pioneer, Tifft
and Arp effects must be seriously considered, guided by the flickering Time-Length-Mass concept.

This article answers several main problems: 
\begin{itemize}
\item 1/ Unification Gravitation-Quantum Physics, by
rehabilitating the forgotten Eddington's statistical theory. 
\item 2/ The real signification of Quantum
Physics, by assuming Physics is based on Arithmetics. 
\item 3/ The overall unification by showing that
cosmology is the basis of United Science. 
\item 4/ The role of dimensionless parameters, by proving that
they are optimal basis of computation tied with the Holographic Principle and its arithmetic form,
the Holic Principle, which explains why normal space has 3 dimensions.
\item 5/ The necessity of the Cosmos vasteness, resulting from holographic scanning and the rationalisation of $e$ and $\pi$
\item 6/ The acceleration of expansion, which was predicted by the Eddington's \textit{invariant} cosmological constant $1/R^2$, is tied to a repulsive force proportional to distance, leading to \textit{exponential} recession. there is no need of the so-called 'dark energy'.
\item 7/ The very existence of dark matter is proven, from the number of neutrons in the trivial fraction 3/10 of the visible Universe critical mass, which identifies with the very symmetric Eddington's number $136 \times 2^{256}$. The nature of dark matter would be simply an anti-phase matter-antimatter oscillation \cite{Sanchez1}.  
\item 8/ The introduction of the Topon in the Holographic Principle justifies at last the $10^{122}$ gap between vacuum energy and that of the visible Universe.
\item 9/ The grandcosmos is huge but not infinite, in conformity with the Cosmological Computational Principle.

In short, the rediscovered cosmos unifies the two main modern cosmologies in a rapid matter-
antimatter oscillatory bounce. The Cosmos appear as \textit{simple, unique, permanent, computational,
deterministic, trans-planckian, cyclic, topological and inverse-anthropic}.

\section{Predictions}
It is now clear that present mathematics and Particle Physics are incomplete, and this Coherent Cosmology announces a reunification of \textit{Philosophy, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Informatics and Biology}. In particular, the pre-Socratic Parmenide philosophy of Permanence must be reconsidered favorably. Eddington's Fundamental Theory must be revisited, specially the genesis of his Large Number, so clearly tied to the $16 \times 16$ symmetric matrix.

      This article leads to some predictions:
\item 1/  The very large infra-red telescopes in preparation will show in the very far field old galaxies instead of expected young ones. Then no artifice, such as inflation, dark energy, multiverse ..., will not save the \textit{already refuted} standard evolutionary model.
\item 2/ The Particle Physics will integrate the Koide relation and introduce massive gluons and composite quark down.
\item 3/ Informatics software should  be boosted by the principle of multi-base computation.
\item 4/ The multiple connexions with the DNA chain seems to imply it is a 1D hologram. Recent studies \cite{Widom} are on this way. 
\end{itemize}
