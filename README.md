# Latex Doc template
A latex doc formatted according to the scientific publication requirement.

### Demos:

1. A link to an online automatic latex build system: [latexonline.cc](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhol137%2Fdoc-latex&target=main.tex&command=pdflatex), [latexbase.com](https://latexbase.com) or try [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)

This project is based on a template by **Alex Liberzon** (@alexlib) that can be found in [here](https://github.com/alexlib/tau_thesis_lyx_template).
Compared to Liberzon's original template, this version contains enhancements and new features including:

1. Adherence to the engineering department updated requirements.
2. A facelift for the title page
3. Nomenclature support
4. Beautiful dedication page
5. Definition and Theorem style
6. With minimal changes it can be used as Ph.D dissertation template
7. Bare Latex - LyX free.

We have made an effort to include an example for every possible type of element needed in a scientific publication or engineerig thesis (table, figure, nomenclatures, numbering, theorem, definition, etc).

**The project files:**
======


- 1.0 **e-journal.sty** - the journal style file.
- 2.0 **main.tex** - the main template file.
- 3.0 **figures** - the directory which should contain your figures.

**Usage notes:**
======

1. The "main" file is the **main.tex**, thus, to render a pdf, run **main.tex**.
2. Your personal information, date can be configured in the main file.
3. The main file also defines the structure, order and numbering of the thesis title pages.
4. The main file define the doc content and order - starting from "\begin{document}"
5. The main file defines all needed keywords - don't hesitate to remove unneeded definitions.


**General Notes:**
======
